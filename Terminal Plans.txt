PLANS FOR TERMINAL (EMULATOR) IN PYTHON:

The goal of this project is to get code something fun for me to use that
I can easily customise and build in custom functions. There are several
things I'd like to do with this project, I have listed them below:

1) The ability to interact with normal commands:
This would allow me to interact with CMD and run normal commands, and
have the output of them piped back to the terminal emulator.

2) Command aliases:
I would like the ability to have short, and simple command aliases for
various programs like pip, conda, and other install services.

3) Custom functions:
I would like the ability to code in different, custom functions that
would assist me in my day-to-day work. An example of this (that kind
of prompted the project) is a dictionary function, where I could run:

dictionary {word1};{word2}

And it would output the definitions of those words. Another example
is that I would like to be able to run custom functions for communicating
with my other hardware (such as the Raspberry Pi and Ardino (an example
of this would be the Arduino Remote Sketch Uploader)) and be able to
run different programs on them and interact with the GPIO pins.

4) Program interaction:
I would like to be able to interact with different programs locally,
I have already coded in the python terminal which is a perfect example of
this.

5) Python script management:
I would like to be able to manage all of my scripts in one place and have
their functionalities accessible from a central point, a couple scripts
I have that would come under this are my bot's code and the factorio 
mod manager.
